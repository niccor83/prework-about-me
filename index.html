      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job as a kid was to be a garbage man, my goals have changed a little as I've grown up but I think I would really enjoy being a web developer.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I received my bachelors degree in Management Information Systems a few years ago. I knew I liked working with computers but wasn't sure what I wanted to do. While in school
        I took a few classes in web development and really enjoyed them. I have always enjoyed building things and being able to see what I have built. Web development gives me the 
        opportunity to combine those things that I enjoy, building and working with computers.
